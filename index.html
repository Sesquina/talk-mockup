        Matt Damon: “These types of movies are going away”
      </h1>

      Mr. Damon, how do you define success? It’s the work. It’s the process
      itself. I have done enough movies now — movies that have failed, movies
      that have been successful. All we have as the people making it is the love
      of the doing of it. I am aware of the results because I have to be; it has
      an impact on my career so I can’t be ignorant of the movies that I am
      doing. But it’s really about feeling that I did my best work, the best
      work I could do under the circumstances, feeling that we told the story we
      wanted to tell in the way we wanted to tell it. That’s really the
      definition of success. So for you it’s about the journey? The journey is
      everything! It’s a cliché, but I have really felt it in my own life, in
      the 25 or 30 years I’ve been in this… The goal is the process, really
      enjoying the process. You can’t really predict what is going to happen
      with movies… I have made movies that I thought were really going to be
      well received and successful, and they failed miserably. And I have made
      movies that were very successful that I didn’t see coming.

        “The truth. The whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.
        And that’s it! May it be ugly, may it be beautiful, may it be perverse,
        may it be all of those things. That’s it, I can’t lie; it is what it is,
        unabashed, naked. I expect that of myself, that’s for sure.”

        “For me it’s a lot about physicality, about how I feel. When you have
        these hardships or when you see someone you love in pain or you
        struggle, all the petty shit goes away. You are like, “I can’t believe I
        was worried about this other thing,” when you see what really matters.”

        something that changes every moment, it’s never repetitive — I try to
        follow this example.”
